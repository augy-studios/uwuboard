#     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File flutter\build-apk.ps1 -Aab     the App Bundle, for Play
#
# The APK is for ARM phones, 32 and 64 bit, in one file (the app's updater fetches the one file):
# uwuboard-<version>.apk. The App Bundle is uwuboard-<version>.aab, Play's own build: no updater of
# its own (src/play/AndroidManifest.xml and UWUBOARD_PLAY take it out, and that's checked here).
#
# Both are shrunk and obfuscated as Google Play asks: R8 on the Java and its libraries, with unused
# resources removed (android/app/build.gradle.kts), and the Dart code obfuscated with its symbols
# split off (--obfuscate --split-debug-info). What reads a crash report back is kept beside them in
# release/<version>/ and never shared: uwuboard-<version>-mapping.txt (R8) and
# uwuboard-<version>-symbols.zip (Dart, for `flutter symbolize`). The App Bundle carries both kinds
# for Play too (R8's mapping, and the native libraries' symbol tables), which is checked here.
#
# Each is signed with android.keystore using the passwords in keystore.properties (both kept out of
# git, README.md), and the signature is checked against the app's own key before it's copied out.
#
# Needs Flutter on the PATH (or FLUTTER_ROOT), a JDK 17 or later and the Android SDK. It finds the
# JDK and SDK in JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME if they're set, or else the newest JDK under Program
# Files and the SDK in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk.
